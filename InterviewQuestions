/* Intersection of 2 sets - Given 2 arrays a[] and b[], each containing 
n distinct 2D points in the plane, design a subquadratic algorithm to count the 
number of points that are contained both a[] and array b[]
Use - Shellsort
*/ 

/* Permutations - Given 2 integer arrays of size n, design a subqudratic algorithm to 
determine whether one is a permutation of the other. That is, do they contain exactly 
the same entries but, possibly in different order
*/

/* Dutch Nation flag - given an array of n buckets, each containing a red, white or blue
pebbles, sort them by color. The allowed operations are: 
- swap(i,j) : swap the pebble in bucket i with the pebble in bucket j
- color(i) : determine the color of the pebble in bucket in j
The performance requirements are as follows : 
- At most n calls to color()
- At most n calls to swap()
- Constant extra space
